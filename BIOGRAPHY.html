            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Im a graduate From Redeemers University, and I have a deep and ongoing passion for the
                tech industry, especially the Web 3 space. My motivation comes from a continuous dedication to looking for
                creative ways to use technology to simplify the complex aspects of our daily life. My drive stems from my
                steadfast belief that technology can reduce the complexity of our daily tasks, giving us the precious time and
                resources to focus on our actual goals and passions. My hobbies are reading and playing video games.

            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>I've chosen Alt School Africa not only to gain a strong foundation in Frontend Engineering and secure a
                well-paying job but also to fulfill my dream of establishing a tech company dedicated to improving people's
                lives. This journey is fueled by a deep-seated desire for quality education and innovation, to drive positive
                change in society, and to create solutions to real-world problems. Moreover, it's about inspiring others,
                fostering community, and empowering individuals to pursue their dreams. As I embark on this path, I am not only
                seeking personal success but also a sense of purpose, a commitment to lifelong learning, and the chance to
                connect with a global community, ultimately making a meaningful impact through technology and entrepreneurship.
